      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)?</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system.  Virtual machines can be cloned nearly instantly, "creating" thousands of new computers, essentially, via the cloud.  This is vastly cheaper and quicker than assembling actual new physical machines.</p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - DigitalOcean?</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud computing infrastructure provider that enables users to create "Droplets" that allow cloud access to virtual machines.  This enables rapid scale increase at a very low monthly price, which removes the excessive hardware cost requirements that would be required should the cloud not be used.</p>
